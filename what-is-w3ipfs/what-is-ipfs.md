# ðŸ“‚ What is IPFS?

IPFS stands for InterPlanetary File System. It is a protocol and distributed file system designed to create a decentralized and more resilient Internet infrastructure. IPFS aims to replace the traditional client-server model of the web with peer-to-peer network.

In IPFS, files and all other forms of data are identified by unique cryptographic hashes, which allow for content-addressing. Instead of referring to files by their location or specific server, IPFS uses content-based addressing to fetch data based on its hash. This means that the same file will always have the same hash, regardless of where it is stored or accessed from.

IPFS also utilizes a distributed hash table (DHT) to facilitate the decentralized nature of the network. The DHT helps in locating and retrieving files by storing information about which peer on the network has a particular file.

By leveraging these technologies, IPFS offers several advantages. It promotes data permanence by storing files across multiple nodes, making it difficult for content to be lost or censored. It also enables faster content delivery by allowing users to fetch files from the closest available peer. Furthermore, IPFS reduces bandwidth requirements since files are cached and shared among users.

IPFS has gained attention as a potential solution for various applications, such as decentralized websites, distributed file sharing, and blockchain-based systems. It aims to provide an open and resilient network infrastructure that is not reliant on a central authority.
