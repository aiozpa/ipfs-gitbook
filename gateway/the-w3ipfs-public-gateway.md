# The W3IPFS Public Gateway

## W3IPFS Public Gateway

The W3IPFS public gateway allows users to access content stored on the IPFS network without running their own IPFS node. It provides a convenient way to retrieve IPFS content through a publicly accessible endpoint. Here's what you need to know:

1. Public Availability: The W3IPFS public gateway is open to all users without requiring authentication or account setup.
2. Accessibility: The gateway allows users to interact with IPFS content using regular web protocols through web browsers and applications.

Important Considerations:

* Limitations: The W3IPFS public gateway has usage limitations and may enforce rate limits or performance restrictions during peak usage. For high-traffic applications or unrestricted access, consider using the [**Dedicated IPFS gateway**](dedicated-gateways.md).
