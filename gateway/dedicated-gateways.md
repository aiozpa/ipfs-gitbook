## Benefits of Dedicated Gateways:

Dedicated gateways for the W3IPFS pinning service provide several advantages:

2. Reliability and High-Performance: Benefit from unmatched speed through a global network of 200+ edge-caching locations.

## Limited Dedicated Gateways:

Free plan users of the W3IPFS pinning service have access to a limited dedicated gateway. This version allows serving individual files like images, videos, and audio. However, files containing HTML and scripts will not be served through the limited dedicated gateway. Upgrading to a paid plan unlocks the full potential of dedicated gateways.
