#### Recommendations

For users with traffic that can be burst-heavy, we recommend using a task scheduler or queue-based upload approach that limits requests to the allowed amount.&#x20;

* Each CID has a global rate limit of 15 requests per minute (this is across all IP addresses)
* Each IP address has a rate limit of 200 requests per minute
