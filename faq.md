## What does it mean to pin content on IPFS?

In IPFS, nodes frequently cache content that gets routed through them. This means that popular content frequently lives on many places of the network at once.

However, eventually, the node cache becomes full, and then garbage collection happens. This means that the node empties its cache to make room for more content.
