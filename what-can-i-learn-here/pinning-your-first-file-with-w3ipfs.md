# üèå‚ôÇ Pinning your first file with W3IPFS

[**Sign in**](https://ipfs.attoaioz.cyou/auth/login) to your W3IPFS account. If you don't have an account, you can create one by [**signing up**](https://ipfs.attoaioz.cyou/auth/register) on the W3IPFS website.

On the [**IPFS Files**](https://ipfs.attoaioz.cyou/dashboard/ipfs-files), you will find options to upload a File, or CID (Content Identifier).

* File: Choose this option if you want to upload a single file of any type, such as images, videos, music, text files, or applications.
* CID: If you already have a Content Identifier (CID), you can enter it here to pin the associated data. CIDs are unique strings of letters and numbers that represent specific pieces of data. This option is particularly relevant for NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) where the CID serves as proof of ownership. Learn more about CIDs [**here**](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/).

**Choose the appropriate upload option, provide a name for your content, and click the "Upload" button. (Note that you can edit the name later if needed)**

Your file is securely stored on IPFS, and you can easily access it from your W3IPFS dashboard whenever you need it.

After pinning your file, the dashboard will provide you with various options to manage your content. Explore these options based on your needs, such as sharing the file, retrieving the CID, or accessing additional information related to the pinned content.

Congratulations! You have now successfully pinned your first file with W3IPFS and made it available on the IPFS network.
