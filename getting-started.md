# ðŸ§‘ðŸ’» Getting Started

[**Sign in**](https://ipfs.attoaioz.cyou/auth/login) to your W3IPFS account. If you don't have an account, you can create one by [**signing up**](https://ipfs.attoaioz.cyou/auth/register) on the W3IPFS website.

## Your API Keys

W3IPFS offers developer keys for various scenarios. The most common scenario is normal IPFS actions (pinning content, unpinning, listing content, etc). These actions happen through the core W3IPFS API and are documented in the W3IPFS API section. You can access and create your W3IPFS API keys here: [**W3IPFS Pinning API Keys Page**](https://ipfs.attoaioz.cyou/dashboard/api-keys)

## Pin Your First File

On the [**IPFS Files**](https://ipfs.attoaioz.cyou/dashboard/ipfs-files), you will find options to upload a File, or CID (Content Identifier).

* File: Choose this option if you want to upload a single file of any type, such as images, videos, music, text files, or applications.
* CID: If you already have a Content Identifier (CID), you can enter it here to pin the associated data. CIDs are unique strings of letters and numbers that represent specific pieces of data. This option is particularly relevant for NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) where the CID serves as proof of ownership. Learn more about CIDs [**here**](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/).

1. In the top right corner, click the "+" button to initiate the pinning process.

4. After selecting the file, **c**hoose the appropriate upload option, provide a name for your content, and click the "Upload" button. (Note that you can edit the name later if needed)
5. After pinning your file, the dashboard will provide you with various options to manage your content. Explore these options based on your needs, such as sharing the file, retrieving the CID, or accessing additional information related to the pinned content.
